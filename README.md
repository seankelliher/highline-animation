## Reflection

Using CSS Animation, I wanted to create a photo by joining "pieces" of it together. I used Photoshop to "slice" a large photo into pieces and Flexbox to position those pieces in the order I needed them. This was not too difficult. The CSS Animation to make the pieces appear was not too difficult either. The most challenging task was finding a pattern and animation speed that looked good. This required time and lots of testing.
